#  E-commerce Application Development Log (AI-Assisted)

This document summarizes the core development steps and outcomes for building the backend and frontend of the e-commerce application, based on a series of AI-driven development prompts.

## 1. Initial Database Schema Definition

* **Goal:** Establish a clear and normalized **NoSQL** data structure.
* **Prompt:** Defined the complete structure for **User**, **Product**, **CartItem**, and **OrderItem** collections, ensuring `User` links to `Cart` (array of `CartItem` IDs) and `OrderHistory` (array of `Order` IDs).
* **Outcome:** A comprehensive `schemas.md` file was generated, detailing field names, data types, and relationships (arrays for one-to-many links) for all four core schemas, laying the foundation for Mongoose models.

## 2. Mongoose Schema Implementation

* **Goal:** Translate the defined NoSQL structure into **Mongoose code**.
* **Prompt:** Generated the corresponding Mongoose schema definitions in separate `.js` files within the `backend/models` directory, including necessary exports.
* **Outcome:** All required Mongoose model files (`user.js`, `product.js`, `cartItem.js`, `orderItem.js`) were created in `backend/models/`, successfully implementing the defined fields and setting up the structure for database interaction.

## 3. Controller and CRUD Operations

* **Goal:** Implement the core backend logic for managing the shopping cart items.
* **Prompt:** In the `CartItem.js` controller, wrote the functions for **CRUD** operations: `createCartItem`, `getCartItem`, `deleteCartItem`, and `updateCartItem`. The update function was constrained to only allow changes to **quantity, size, and gift fields**.
* **Outcome:** The `cartItem.js` controller was generated, containing four distinct, functional methods. The `updateCartItem` function specifically enforced the business logic constraint, preventing unauthorized field updates.

## 4. Advanced Backend Features

* **Goal:** Add necessary search and filter logic to the **Product API**.
* **Prompt:** In the `product.js` controller, created a `getAllProducts` function to handle a **`searchQuery`** parameter (using MongoDB's `$regex` on `productName`) and a **`sort`** parameter (to sort results based on the `price` field).
* **Outcome:** The `product.js` controller was updated with a powerful `getAllProducts` function. It successfully implemented case-insensitive regex search for product names and added conditional logic to apply ascending or descending price sorting based on query parameters.

---

## 5. Frontend Service Layer Creation

* **Goal:** Establish a clear separation of concerns in the frontend by creating a dedicated layer for API communication.
* **Prompt:** Created a `frontend/src/services` directory and, for every backend controller, a corresponding service file (e.g., `cartItemService.js`). Each file included **fetch API functions** to call all respective backend endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* **Outcome:** A complete `frontend/src/services` folder was created. It contains the necessary JavaScript files (e.g., `productService.js`, `cartItemService.js`), each holding dedicated, reusable asynchronous functions for interacting with the backend API.

---

## 6. UI Component and Backend Integration

* **Goal:** Build the primary product display page and integrate it with the newly created frontend service.
* **Prompt:** Created the main **`Home.jsx`** component. Implemented a header, utilized the `productService` to fetch all products, and mapped them to display as **Product Cards** (showing `productName`, `price`, and an 'Add to Cart' button).
* **Outcome:** The `Home.jsx` page was successfully created as a functional React component. It correctly utilized the frontend `productService` to fetch and render the product data, demonstrating successful UI component creation and full-stack data integration.
